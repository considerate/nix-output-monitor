## 2.0.0.7 -- 2023-09-17

* Bump hermes-json dependency to 0.6.0.0

## 2.0.0.6 -- 2023-05-14

## 2.0.0.5 -- 2022-11-28

* Fix a bug, where nom failed to parse build errors in json mode.
* Improve test suite, including regressions for this bug.

## 2.0.0.4 -- 2022-11-21

* nom will now not show json parsing errors when something was not a json message from nix. #69
* `nom develop` and `nom shell` will now work when the user specifies a `--command` #69

* Fix formatting for transfer host labels.
* Declutter tree: Only show timers over 1s. Reduce host label colors.

## 2.0.0.0 -- 2022-10-15

### Highlights:

* **New ways to use nom**, via different aliases and options. Have a look at the README for new usage or just try `nom build`, `nom develop` or `nom-build` …
* **Full support for new-style nix commands like `nix build`** and therefor also flakes.
* Support for parsing the nix "internal-json" log format. This gives us much more information.
* The output has been massively reworked to accommodate the new information available from json output. This includes:
  * Running downloads/uploads
  * Show current build phase (only possible for local builds).
  * Remote builders are displayed more economically
  * Build summaries have been reworked to be less overwhelming
  * Log output is prefixed with build job names.
* Massive internal refactoring with significant performance improvements and less flickering.

### Further changes:

* The algorithm to layout the rendering tree has been improved.
* Improved build name display and show build platform if different from our platform.
* Better error reporting.
* Pause build time counter while system is suspended.
* Fixed a color flickering issue in the dependency graph (thx @alyssais).
* Removed some weird operators. (thx @blachheaven)
* The old nom-build wrapper is obsolete and has been removed.
* Updated to use ghc 9.2 with corresponding features like GHC2021 and RecordDotSyntax.
* Added benchmarking and profiling scripts, to monitor performance.
* Most performance improvements came from replacing aeson with json-hermes.
